When a police radio message reports a crime, the enclosing navigation zone is used to describe the area. Every block in the city must be within some navigation zone. They can overlap, in which case the smaller area zone gets priority. It is not allowed for equally sized zones to overlap. The navigation zone names are not translated in foreign versions of the game – they always have the same name. For large areas, the game appends North, South, etc. to the displayed name, so as to give the player a better idea of where he is.
